This filter adds a WYSIWYM editor to Radiant.


== About WYMeditor

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code, to conform to the W3C XHTML specifications and to facilitate further processing by modern applications.

== Requirements

If your Radiant is pre-0.6.7, you need the shards extension. See http://groups.google.com/group/radiantcms-dev/browse_frm/thread/d07f7fffd84b3ce0/5efa6fd6c2e1668e?lnk=gst&q=shards#5efa6fd6c2e1668e


== Installation

Run this rake command to copy all needed files into the public folder:

	rake radiant:extensions:wym_editor_filter:install

That's it! You should now have "Wym Editor" in the filters dropdown on the page edit screen. Selecting this will spawn a WYMeditor instance.


== Changelog

Updated to wym 0.5a-1, and fixed empty <td> problem.
0.3.2: Updated to work with radiant 0.6.5. Thanks David Piehler and Tim Blair
0.3.1: Fixed includes for opera & safari, now works fine on those browsers too

== Known issues

Does not work properly with Safari: when you have containers present in the editor, and you click any button that calls a dialog (preview, table, link popups), the entire #content div will be replaced by a regexp string.
