This filter adds a WYSIWYM editor to Radiant.

== About WYMeditor

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code, to conform to the W3C XHTML specifications and to facilitate further processing by modern applications.

== Requirements

You need the shards extension for this to work. See http://groups.google.com/group/radiantcms-dev/browse_frm/thread/d07f7fffd84b3ce0/5efa6fd6c2e1668e?lnk=gst&q=shards#5efa6fd6c2e1668e

== Installation

From within your Radiant's instance folder, export this filter into vendor/extensions:

	cd path/to/instance/vendor/extensions
	svn export svn://zuurstof.openminds.be/home/kaizer/svn/rails_stuff/radiant_extensions/wym_editor_filter
	
Now run this rake command to copy all needed files into the public folder:

	rake radiant:extensions:wym_editor_filter:install

That's it! You should now have "Wym Editor" in the filters dropdown on the page edit screen. Selecting this will spawn a WYMeditor instance.

== Known issues

* At least on firefox, you get a JS error for every keystroke. This doesn't break anything though. This will be fixed when i figure out why the filter doesn't work with jQuery 1.4.


== Changelog

0.3: Radius tags are now handled properly. They are replaced with an image that holds the respective tag in it's alt attribute.
0.2: now uses shards to alter the admin interface, so it doesn't interfere with other extensions
